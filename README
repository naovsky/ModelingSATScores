This project is based on multiple statistical analysis techniques and includes heavy assumption testing which is key in a project with
so much data compilation. The write-up and code should be enough to walk you through the majority of the logic, but if you'd like
deeper understanding of the statistical methods, feel free to do your own research.

The paper has not been published and I have not attempted to do so.

The data comes from multiple U.S. Census databases which were then mended together directly in excel.

Before running code, make sure that you a) have all the R packages downloaded and b) have replaced the excel sheets import with the 
location of the data on your computer. It may be more helpfult to run the code line by line, as it outputs information.
